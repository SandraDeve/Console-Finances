# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

# Overview

The main purpose of this project is creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. I have been provided with a financial dataset in the `starter/index.js` file. I had tutoring session regarding loops and iteration and used https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration as a quide.

# Description

I am required to provide analytical information(using JavaScript code) that includes:

1. The overall number of months that the dataset encompasses.
2. The overall sum of Profit/Losses for the entire period.
3. The average difference in Profit/Losses for the entire period.
4. The largest increase in profits (including the date and amount) throughout the entire period.
5. The largest decrease in losses (including the date and amount) throughout the entire period.

My final code should print the analysis to the console. Please see the screenshot below:
